This is the recommend means of setting up data.adicu.com for development.
First, you will need to pull in all the git submodules.

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Next, install [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/).
Once vagrant is installed, you can run `vagrant up`, and vagrant will provision the virtual machine for you.
Then you can ssh into vagrant and start the app.
You can point your browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to see the running app.

  vagrant ssh
  cd /vagrant
  source config/settings.dev
  cd data
  python data.py

    cd dev
    sh load_dev_dump.sh
